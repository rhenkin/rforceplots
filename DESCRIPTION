Description: The package is a stand-alone wrapper for the shapjs package to facilitate rendering additive force plots in R without depending on Python or reticulate.
  It is compatible with the fastshap, shapr and shapper packages and includes bindings for Shiny and for the three base visualisation functions from shapjs.
