# rforceplots

<!-- badges: start -->

rforceplots is as a stand-alone wrapper for the [shapjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shapjs) node package to facilitate rendering additive force plots in R. It does not require Python or reticulate and is compatible with objects exported by the `shapper::individual_variable_effect()` and `shapr::explain()` functions. It's compatible with Shiny and gives access to the three base visualization functions from the shapjs node package for custom SHAP explanation formats.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rforceplots like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("rhenkin/rforceplots")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rforceplots)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
